	<p>This essay investigates the transformative personal, social, and political power of the Black horror genre. In the introductory class to "Sunken Place..." Prof. Due  ascribed her mother's love of horror films to her deep involvement in the Civil Rights movement. Prof. Due's mother put her freedom and well-being on the line to standup to the injustices of racism and discrimination, suffering both physical violence and incarceration for her courage. The direct connection Prof. Due made between her mother's deep involvement in the Civil Rights movement and her love of horror films surprised me, as it seemed counter-intuitive that someone who had experienced and fought against the terror of white supremacy would willing consume horror narratives as a pastime, especially with the way Black characters were often treated in these films, if included at all. </p>
