The horror film genre, often associated with spine-chilling thrills and terrifying narratives, has long been a prominent and influential part of the cinematic landscape. While some may view horror films as mere sources of entertainment, it is crucial to recognize the positive impact that this genre can have on society. Contrary to popular belief, horror films serve as more than just vessels for scares; they contribute to societal well-being by offering catharsis, fostering empathy, and addressing societal fears.

This essay investigates the transformative personal, social, and political power of the Black horror genre. In the introductory class to "Sunken Place..." Prof. Due  ascribed her mother's love of horror films to her deep involvement in the Civil Rights movement. Prof. Due's mother put her freedom and well-being on the line to standup to the injustices of racism and discrimination, suffering both physical violence and incarceration for her courage. The direct connection Prof. Due made between her mother's deep involvement in the Civil Rights movement and her love of horror films surprised me, as it seemed counter-intuitive that someone who had experienced and fought against the terror of white supremacy would willing consume horror narratives as a pastime, especially with the way Black characters were often treated in these films, if included at all. 

Prof. Due surmised that horror films helped her mother process the daily horrors she experienced as a Black woman raised during Jim Crow—an era following the US Civil War of extreme racism and violent oppression of Black people. As an interesting aside, the name of this era has its origins in the entertainment industry. "Jim Crow" was the name of an "exaggerated, highly stereotypical black character" made famous by Thomas Dartmouth Rice—a struggling white actor who would perform in blackface make up (https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/timeline/jimcrow.htm). This racist caricature was apparently so palpable that by 1838 "Jim Crow" was being used as a popular racial epithet for black people (https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/timeline/jimcrow.htm). Given the terror and hostility of this era towards Black people and the constant state of fear that was their daily experience, it surprised me that some might still seek horror as entertainment or healing. In contrast, I have peers from parts of the world that have experienced violence from war and civil strife, and consequently had no interest in consuming violence as entertainment, whether through film, sporting events, or video games. But, the connection Prof. Due made between her mother's interest in horror and the personal, political, and social impact she made through her activism, stuck with me throughout the course, as it raised the question whether art (in general), or the Black horror genre specifically, could catalyze meaningful transformation. 

In this essay, I will speak to some of the unique attributes of the Black horror subgenre to analyze the potential it has to be a potent catalyst for social change. what makes it a social change agent with powerful potential. The transformative properties of Black horror I will be looking at are: 1) the transformative process of making; 2) black gaze; 3) catharsis and emotional release; 4) empathy and social commentary; 5) confronting the unknown. In addition to using examples of Black horror we have reviewed in class, I will employ the scholarship of Anaïs Duplan and Tina M. Campt on the cultural, social, and political impact of contemporary Black artists. Campt and Duplan's research focuses primarily on Black artists in the fine art space, providing plenty of parallels concerning some of the ways contemporary Black horror creators are shaping culture and cinema.

What is meant by social change?
Typically, when people want to make changes at the societal level, politics and policy are the arenas that are pursued. Consequently, many of the actions of the Civil Rights movement targeted specific policies at the national, state, and local levels. But in addition to targeting policy, movement leaders and organizers sought to change the hearts and minds (i.e., the culture, values, attitudes, and perspectives) of people as well. This can be seen in the means they chose to make their voices heard and provoke change. The agenda of non-violent civil disobedience in the face of dehumanizing policies and brutal reprisals was intended to bring the horrors of white supremacy to the surface and force dominant American society to contend with its violence and injustice before the eyes of the world. The fashion and aesthetics of the Black Power movement were intended to instill a sense of pride and empowerment in being Black, encouraging us to step into our power and protect ourselves from the physical and psychological violence of white supremacy. Both strategies targeted the spirit of the people as well as unjust policies. While policy paired with the threat of state sanctioned violence/punishment may dictate what we are or are not able to do, it is the spirit of the people that catalyzes the formulation of policy in the first place, as well as influences its validity and enforceability long term. Art, cinema, and music are major shapers of culture and the social zeitgeist. Shame, sympathy, and desire are powerful emotions, strong enough to build political movements and achieve positive political outcomes. But could the horror film genre create this type of impact?

There is certainly historical evidence of the horror film genre's ability to impact culture and policy, although not necessarily in positive ways that promote justice and peace. D. W. Griffith's 1915 silent American drama, *The Birth of a Nation* (originally titled *The Clansman*), was wildly popular amongst white audiences across the US, grossing more than any previous motion picture. and receiving high praise from the likes of President Woodrow Wilson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation). 

The film portrayed its black characters (many of whom are played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent, sexually aggressive, and monstrous, particularly towards white women who symbolize the purity of America (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation). The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is placed as a heroic counter force, "necessary to preserve American values, protect white women, and maintain white supremacy" against the monstrous caricature of Black men (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation). Because the plot of the film was part horror/fiction and part history, audiences mistook it as real. This sentiment was only furthered by a publicist who claimed President Woodrow Wilson at an advanced screening of the film at the White House exclaimed, "It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true." There is some controversy whether Wilson actually said these words or liked the film, but nevertheless the quote was used in promoting the film and was extremely effective at driving interest and belief in it. 

Consequently, the commercial success of *The Birth of a Nation* and the fear it raised of Black men contributed to policies of racial segregation throughout the US, numerous lynchings and acts of racialized violence, and the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan only a few months after the film's release. The Ku Klux Klan had been disbanded in the 1870s due to lack of popularity and a Federal Grand Jury's determination that the Klan was a "terrorist organization" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Second_Klan:_1915%E2%80%931944). Furthermore, much of the modern Klan's iconography was derived from the depictions in the film and the book it's based on, such as the standardized white hood and robes and the burning cross (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Second_Klan:_1915%E2%80%931944). It is clear from these results that cinema and the horror genre have to create real policy outcomes and shape culture. The terrible impact of *The Birth of a Nation* is testament to the power media has to influence society, particularly popular, engaging, and easily distributable mediums like film that are capable of evoking strong emotional responses.  

Prior to this course, I viewed horror films as simply a vehicle for cheap thrills and terrifying/grotesque narratives. While admittedly not my favorite genre, horror has undeniably long been a prominent and influential part of the cultural and cinematic landscape. I attribute part of horror's outsized influence to the fact that its distinguishing feature operates on a primal part of the human brain—the amygdala. The amygdala's primary function is to process memory, decision making, and emotional responses, especially fear, anxiety, and aggression. This is a portion of the brain located close to the brainstem that developed early on in human evolution (as opposed to other portions of the brain that have grown over time) which helps it regulate many other parts of the body and operate on an instinctual/subconscious level. Given the primal significance of this portion of the brain and its impact on memory, decision making, and emotion, fear has long been used to influence human behavior, especially when paired with narrative. "Narrative is both an esthetic and a political tool, wielded by agents who hold power to produce some felt effect in a reader—or colonial subject." (Duplan, pg. 3). We see fear and narrative used together to provoke, direct, and justify any number of actions and agendas, not just in films, but everything from superstitions to propaganda.


**Transformative Process of Making**

—Us, a way for Jordan Peele to process his experience as a wealthy/successful Black man in Hollywood.
—Dredd Scott Slave Rebellion Staging.

While D. W. Griffith's film *The Birth of a Nation* is an example of how horror can have an extremely damaging and lasting impact on culture, society, and the film industry, that same potential can be used towards positive social change if guided in the right way. One often overlooked way is through the transformative effects art has on its makers. I can personally speak to the way artistic research and production has built deep, personal relationships with the subject matter of my work. The act of observing, processing, and translating my surroundings through poetic expression benefits from a deepened understanding of the subject matter along multiple intelligences—conceptual, emotional, embodied, etc. In instances of production that require collaboration, like filmmaking, that personal transformative process becomes a shared experience. As Duplan writes: 

"Daily, I am enmeshed in a constellation of oppressions, which we could call the white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy. Has my life been predestined? Can I pursue liberation? What kind of liberation can I pursue? ....So far, I've found that one of my best opportunities for liberation is in esthetic experience. When I'm rushed by the smell of patties walking past a bakery, I'm having an esthetic experience. Works of art can provide these moments, too. Art magnifies the sensual qualities found in my daily experiences....Sense is meaning. Without sense, there is no volition, motion, participation, or communication." (Duplan, pg. 1-2)

When I look at the origins of Black artistic forms of expression such as blues, jazz, hiphop, afrofuturism, and Black horror, I see a common thread—an attempt to find meaning amidst a "constellation of oppressions." Occasionally what we find changes us, and in some instances, that internal shift reverberates outwards to shape our surroundings. I see an example of this in the story of Bree Newsome Bass, writer and director of the 2010 indie Black horror film *Wake*. Bree wrote, produced, directed, and edited the short film as a graduate student at NYU Tisch school. *Wake* is about a sheltered Black woman who murders her father and resorts to the use of magic called "root work" to conjure her ideal husband. Rather than gruesome depictions, the film relies upon symbolism and editing to bring up challenging themes such as the oppressive role and societal expectations of Black women in the South, domestic violence, desire, and death. 

Despite the numerous awards her film received, Bree Newsome Bass is probably best known for her activism. In 2015, in the wake of the violent murder of eight black parishioners and their pastor at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston SC at the hands of a lone white supremacist, Newsome Bass scaled a flagpole to take down a Confederate battle flag being flown outside the State Capitol. As Tariro Mzezewa of the New York Times explains, "Ms. Newsome Bass believed then that the flag, along with the hundreds of Confederate statues and emblems across the country were symbols of oppression that shouldn't have a place in 21st-century America" (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/politics/bree-newsome-bass-confederate-flag.html). Ms. Newsome Bass knew she would be arrested for her act of civil-disobedience, but she proceeded with the action anyways, believing that taking down the symbols that "memorialize history and actions that are deeply painful to many....is part of working toward meaningful change in terms of policy, voting and creating a society in which black people's lives and opinions are considered equal to others" (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/politics/bree-newsome-bass-confederate-flag.html_). Newsome Bass' actions and the publicity it received put national pressure on South Carolina state officials to permanently remove the Confederate flag, which they did on July 10th of 2015. As a filmmaker, Newsome Bass understood the importance of symbolism in shaping concrete outcomes. She expressed as much in saying that "her experience as a black woman working the horror and sci-fi film genres inspired her to become an activist" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bree_Newsome).

**Black Gaze**
—Telling our own narratives without the filtering, consumption, or catering to whiteness.
—Forming own audiences
—Controlling tech, production, marketing, and distribution tools/platforms/channels.
—Ex. Monkey Paw & Candyman Remake
—Ex. Older Black director trying to portray positive blackness.
—"It is a Black gaze that shifts the optics of "looking at" to a politics of *looking with, through, and alongside another*." (Campt, pg. 8)

Another significant way Black horror—particularly contemporary Black horror—is shaping culture and society is by shifting the lens through which Blackness is consumed. Jordan Peele, along with his collaborators through his production company Monkey Paw, are amongst a new wave of Black creators from various disciplines invested in centering "the Black gaze" in their work, rather than modifying their work for the pallets and consumption of white audiences. Get Out, Us, Candyman, and Nope all feature complex Black leads navigating fictional situations that directly or metaphorically represent horror from a distinctly Black perspective/experience. While these narratives are consumable to non-black audiences, they prioritize the needs, beliefs, desires, opinions, and accessibility of Black audiences over others. For example, Jordan Peele mentioned in an interview that if his characters or the actions they take in the film are not relatable to a Black audience, then he reworks it. In her book *A Black Gaze: Artists Changing How We See*, Tina Campt argues that this centering of the black gaze by the contemporary wave of "Black artist-entrepreneurs," (such as Jordan Peele and Monkey Paw), is largely possible through technological advances of the internet, social media, modes of production, marketing, and media outlets (Campt, pg. 6). With access to their own means of production and publishing platforms, Black creators are able to circumvent white gatekeepers in music, television, film, and publishing industries, creating new outlets of expression for themselves and other emerging artists (Campt, pg. 6). This is a significant shift as it has made it possible for contemporary Black-produced work to reach a broader audience without needing to cater to a white market or gaze. Campt sees this as evidence of the emergence of a politically motivated Black artistic renaissance comparable in impact on the cultural politics of the nation to the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s (Campt, pg. 5). This renaissance isn't just because of increased representation, either. Campt makes a distinction between Black representation in art and media and the creation of a Black point of view that challenges dominant ways of narrating the Black experience. She explains: 

"...while contemporary Black-produced popular culture brings broader visibility to Black life and history, more often than not its emphasis centers on the *depiction* of Black people and communities, while maintaining existing limitations of traditional ways of narrating the Black experience. Although it often proceeds from a Black point of view, its major accomplishment is frequently that and that alone. It adds an additional perspective—a Black perspective—but it doesn't necessarily challenge the fundamental premise of the existing framework for viewing blackness. It does not challenge the fundamental disparity that defines the dominant viewing practice: the fact that blackness is the elsewhere (or nowhere) of whiteness." (Campt, pg. 7) 

Campt is making the argument that Black representation and authorship are not enough to constitute a creative work that centers the Black gaze; such a work must also challenge the existing framework for viewing blackness—i.e. the dominant white perspective that distances, marginalizes, and "others" blackness. She continues:

"In this approach to Black visuality, while blackness is now seen (i.e., made visible to a wider audience), it is not necessarily something to be felt. Much too often, Black life is rendered in ways that allow it to be engaged at a safe distance or viewed at arm's length through a lens of pity, sympathy, or concern. It is a temporary point of connection, visited and left behind in the face of an inevitable return to the comfort and comforting perspective of self and "home."" (Campt, pg. 7)

Poverty porn, ethno-voyeurism, and the consumption of Black pain narratives have long been issues in art, cinema, and mass media. It is not uncommon to find a perverse fascination and fetishization of Blackness within white supremacy. Jordan Peele hints at this in Get Out with Rose's grandfather Roman Armitage, who is reportedly unable to recover psychologically from losing to the legendary Black athlete Jesse Owens in the qualifying round of the olympics. Roman consequently devises a system for the theft of Black bodies to use as hosts for aging wealthy white people. Campt's main point is that the white gaze has a voyeuristic desire of consuming Blackness, but only at a safe distance, for a temporary length of time, and in so far as it reaffirms pre-established perspectives and beliefs about Blackness. 

There are Black artists, however, who are challenging this consumption. Campt attests that there are "Black artists in mainstream popular culture" and "Black fine artists" who are:

"initiating a different and, I would argue, more transformative cultural, aesthetic, and indeed, political shift that is drawing unprecedented attention. They are shifting the very nature of our interactions with the visual through their creation and quite literal curation of a distinctively *Black* gaze.... Neither a depiction of Black folks or Black culture, it is a gaze that forces viewers to engage blackness from a different and discomforting vantage point....Their artistic practices mobilize Black precarity as a creative force of affirmation that cannot simply be seen or viewed. It is a Black gaze that shifts the optics of "looking at" to a politics of *looking with, through, and alongside another*. It is a gaze that requires effort and exertion...."(Campt, pg. 8). 

A new wave of Black creators in popular culture and fine art are making work not simply about Black people and with Black people, but also from a distinctly complex and nuanced Black perspective. This shift in POV challenges the viewer by diminishing the buffer between them and the Black experience, forcing them to recalibrate and contend with their relationship to Blackness. 

The contrast between the original Candyman movie and the remake by Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele provides a tangible example between making work  about Black people versus making work that centers the Black gaze. While Jordan Peele has been intentional about approaching the horror genre in a way that features Black characters and challenges typical tropes (the magical guide, the sacrificial Black person, the first to die, etc.), the Candyman remake was a deliberate attempt to retell the Candyman story from a position of Blackness.  The 1992 version of Candyman, directed by Bernard Rose, utilized Black characters and situated the story in a predominantly Black setting—the Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago. Some saw this as progressive for the time, particularly for the horror genre which was/is dominated by narratives of white people in white suburban settings. Others found it problematic, as the representation of Black people played on prevailing troubling racial depictions rather than challenging them. Black men were depicted as violent and aggressive "super predators". Black children were pitiful and in need of rescue. Black neighborhoods were filthy, decrepit, concrete jungles of crime as a consequence of the shortcomings of the inhabitants rather than social, economic, or systemic factors. Black women, like Helen's friend Bernadette, were almost a non-entity aside from being a cover/mouthpiece to voice thoughts White people were thinking but couldn't say without appearing racist. So, while Candyman was adapted to tell a narrative in a predominantly Black setting with a predominantly Black cast, the film approaches the story in a way that caters to the white gaze, reifying rather than challenging the dominant society's view of blackness. 

When Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele decided to take up the Candyman story, they wanted to retell it from a distinctly Black perspective, in part as a critique of the prior film and as a reclamation of a Black horror figure/narrative. In their rewrite, instead of Candyman preying on white women and indiscriminately killing his own people, Candyman's monsterousness is a response to the trauma and violence Black people experience under white supremacy in America. This general abstraction is reflected in the identity of Candyman, who isn't any one person, but rather a symbol, legend, and an amalgamation of tragic victims to white supremacy—Daniel Robitaille, Sherman Fields, Anthony McCoy etc. As the character William Burke explains about Candyman, "he's the whole damn hive." Each killer bee that accompanies Candyman symbolizes a victim that not only makes Candyman, but makes him necessary. It is a bee sting, while investigating the former grounds of the Cabrini Green projects, that begins Anthony's transformation/descent into madness, a wound that consumes him much like the sting he feels from the declining interest in his art work by white art institutions. Each bee represents the hundreds of stings Black people suffer in a white supremacist society, the totality of which too often proves fatal, as was the case in the origin story of Candyman when the lynchmob swarmed Daniel Robitaille, cut off his right hand, and smeared him with honeycomb stolen from an apiary, attracting bees that stung him to death—DaCosta smartly depicted the violence against Daniel Robitaille using shadow puppets as a way of talking about Black trauma without retraumatizing the audience. DaCosta's use of shadow puppets in particular puts the scene in conversation with another Black artist deftly employing the Black gaze—Kara Walker. Kara Walker's artwork uses shadow puppetry and film "to expose the ongoing psychological injury caused by the tragic legacy of slavery" and to lead "viewers to a critical understanding of the past while also proposing an examination of contemporary racial and gender stereotypes" (https://walkerart.org/collections/artists/kara-walker). In the original film, Candyman is a narcissist with a god complex that indiscriminately kills (mostly his own community) to affirm his legend, but in DaCosta's version, Candyman is untethered rage and retribution for grave injustice. This reframing gives Candyman complexity and dimension—he is a weapon, a memorial, and a cautionary symbol of the violence violence begets, since Candyman's retribution is violent, extreme, and messy, often spilling over and claiming the just and unjust alike. These moves reframe the story of Candyman from a Black perspective by giving the actions context that are relatable within the Black experience. An aspect of the film that I think contributes to the Black gaze is that it's not so conveniently about race. The film also calls into question intersectional identities around class, as Anthony and Brianna are essentially Black gentrifiers moving into a beautiful new apartment developed in the aftermath of the Cabrini Green projects' demolition. "They’re not bad people, but they have massive blind spots, and DaCosta’s story demands her characters examine themselves. “The mirrors absolutely metaphorically have that meaning,” she says. What they see reflected back may determine their fates" (https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/08/candyman-comes-for-the-privileged). If the film were purely about Black and White race relations and seeking 1-to-1 retribution for the evils of racism, it would lose dimension, making it too easy to read and compartmentalize for the audience. While some might see increased legibility as beneficial, I agree with Campt in her belief that there's an opportunity for greater transformation in situating "a gaze that forces viewers to engage blackness from a different and discomforting vantage point" and that deals creatively with Black precarity to discourage simply "looking at" and instead encourage "a politics of *looking with, through, and alongside another*," even if it requires greater "effort and exertion" from the viewer (Campt, pg. 8). 

The contemporaneity of today's media-arts technologies doesn't alone signal that the contemporary work being created with them is avant-garde, where avant-garde means both "new" and marginal to a hegemonic meaning-making framework. And again, given this history of media works within a traceable, if ineffable, black esthetic tradition and the body of their critical analysis, at least a portion of the work by black contemporary artists that seeks opposition through illegibility has now become—or is at risk of becoming—hyper-legible in "sympathetic" white-dominated art spaces that do not otherwise stake a real claim in challenging a socio-racial hegemony." (Duplan, pg. 19-20)


**Catharsis and Emotional Release**
—Expression or allusion to trauma or fear ideally without retraumatizing the viewer.
	—Puppet scene in Candyman remake
	—Godzilla expression of trauma and fear felt by Japanese around nuclear holocaust.
	—Wet pain by placing story of haunting/possession in the setting of Hurricane Katrina and the horrors experience by Black folks during that natural and manmade disaster.

```
One of the primary ways in which horror films positively impact society is through the cathartic experience they provide to viewers. Psychologically, the horror genre allows individuals to confront and process their deepest fears in a controlled environment. The intense emotions elicited during a horror film, such as fear, anxiety, and suspense, offer a form of emotional release. By confronting and overcoming these fears vicariously through the characters on screen, viewers may find relief from their own anxieties in real life.

Moreover, the adrenaline rush and heightened emotional states induced by horror films trigger the release of endorphins, promoting a sense of euphoria after the initial fear has subsided. This emotional rollercoaster can be both exhilarating and therapeutic, offering a temporary escape from the stresses of everyday life.
```

**Empathy and Social Commentary**
—Creates enough distance from the actual trauma to allow us to discuss/process difficult topics
—Ex. Us (our own darker urges) and Get Out (white female complicity in the structure of Black capture and death)
—Night of the Living Dead (inability to resolve personal issues to come together to escape/defeat the slowmoving existential threats of the zombies)
—Wet Pain (fiction short story to describe the haunting/lingering legacy of white supremacy in the "New South" that manifested in devastating ways during Hurricane Katrina)
—4:44 and Lemonade (processing of feelings around infidelity and disrespect in Black love/relationships)

```
Horror films often delve into the darker aspects of human nature and societal issues, creating narratives that provoke thought and discussion. Through the lens of supernatural or monstrous elements, horror films can address underlying societal fears and challenges, prompting audiences to reflect on their own beliefs and values.

For example, films like Jordan Peele's "Get Out" and "Us" use horror tropes to explore themes of racism and societal divisions. By placing these issues in a context that is both fantastical and horrifying, filmmakers can foster empathy and understanding among viewers. Horror films serve as a mirror reflecting societal fears, enabling audiences to engage in meaningful conversations about pressing issues.
```

**Confronting the Unknown**
```
The horror genre is often centered around the fear of the unknown, confronting viewers with the mysterious and unexplained. In a society where uncertainties and fears of the future are prevalent, horror films provide a platform for individuals to confront and cope with the unknown in a controlled environment. This exposure to fear in a fictional setting can empower individuals to face real-world uncertainties with resilience and courage.

Furthermore, the horror genre has a long history of challenging societal norms and taboos. By pushing boundaries and exploring the forbidden, horror films contribute to the evolution of societal perspectives, fostering a more open and accepting culture.
